I recently started learning PyTorch. One of my main issues with PyTorch coming from a keras background was it's lack of premade everyday functionalities like plotting the loss, loading a dataset, etc.

Snippet extensions for editors like VS-Code solve a big part of this problem but the problem with extensions is that they don't necessarily work with cloud based tools like Google Colab and Kaggle.

So I made a website for it. currently it hosts about 35 useful snippets that I have gathered along the way but hopefully it will grow in the future.
any feedbacks and shares are appreciated.
